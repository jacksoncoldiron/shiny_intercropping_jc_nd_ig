Intercropping is an agricultural practice where two crop species are grown together in the same field to maximize resource use and improve productivity. It enhances biodiversity, reduces pest pressure, and can improve soil health by optimizing nutrient cycling.

Schematic illustrations and examples of alternative intercropping strategies.

a.  **Strip intercropping:** both species grown simultaneously with alternating strips wide enough for separate management but close enough to interact beneficially, improving soil health, pest control, and overall yield stability

b.  **Relay strip intercropping:** one crop is planted in strips and another is sown into those strips before the first crop is harvested, allowing for temporal overlap and efficient land use.

c.  **Alternate-row intercropping:** two crops are planted in alternating rows within the same field to optimize resource use, enhance biodiversity, and improve yield stability.

d.  **Mixed intercropping** two crops are grown together in the same field without a distinct row arrangement, allowing for natural plant interactions that optimize resource use and enhance biodiversity.

e.  A mini tractor sowing soybean and applying fertilizer in maize/soybean relay strip intercropping.

f.  Relay strip intercropping of maize and soybean.

g.  A soybean harvester working in a soybean strip in Southwest China.

h.  Alternate-row intercropping of durum wheat and winter pea in France.

i.  Mixed lentil/spring wheat intercropping at harvest.

j.  Mechanical harvest of mixed lentil/spring wheat intercropping in France.

## App Guide

**Intercropping by Continent:** Explore intercropping experiments over the years. Choose your own continents and time frames!

**Map of Experiments:** Find the places around the world intercropping the most. Click a country to see how many experiments they have done, the most common crop they use and the most common intercropping system they use.

**LER by Crop Types:** Learn which combinations of crops perform the best in terms of Land Equivalent Ratio (LER).

**Principal Component Analysis:** Compare which factors in the intercropping experiments played the largest role. How does intercropping in China compare to the rest of the world? Which experiment variable contributed most to LER performance?

## Data

Data is derived from a comprehensive meta-analysis of global intercropping experiments. All observations are from field experiments published worldwide from 1982 and 2022. Included in the data are (i) general information on the experiments; (ii) experimental site soil and climate conditions; (iii) descriptions of intercropping designs; (iv) crop management practices; (v) measurements of sole crop and intercrop yields and (vi) Land Equivalent Ratios.
